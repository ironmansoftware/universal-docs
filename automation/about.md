# About Automation

### Run Scripts

You can run [scripts ](scripts/)in PowerShell Universal. PowerShell Universal integrates deeply with the PowerShell host to provide a UI for param blocks, output rich objects, display progress and even allow the user to provide feedback.

### Schedule Jobs

You can schedule jobs to [run continuously](schedules.md#continuous), [at certain times ](schedules.md#cron)or even [when events happen](triggers.md) within the PowerShell Universal platform.
