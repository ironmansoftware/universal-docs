# Notifications

PowerShell Universal can generate notifications for numerous reasons. These can include operations such as restarting a dashboard or a configuration error.&#x20;

Notifications are available by clicking the bell icon within the admin console.&#x20;

## Levels

Notifications can be Information, Warning or Error levels. When an error level notification is generated, the bell icon will change to an exclamation mark and change to red.&#x20;

You can configure which levels are generated by navigating to Settings \ General \ Admin Console. Change the Notification Level setting to the lowest level you'd like to see. For example, if you set it to Warning, you will only see Warning and Error notifications.&#x20;
