DESCRIPTION
    Defines a new role within PowerShell Universal. Roles are used to define authorization within the PowerShell Universal platform. Roles can be assigned statically to an Identity or can be assigned by the -Policy script block. The policy script block receives a $User parameter that contains the identity information and claims that an identity has been granted during authentication.
    
    Policy script blocks need to return either $true or $false to determine whether this particular identity should be provided the role.
    
    Roles configurations are stored in .universal/roles.ps1
    
    You can also use this cmdlet to create roles through the REST API.
